# open-stealth
Open sourced stealth game codebase, to kickstart your next project

# Origin
The project started as project for Software Engineering classes at my University. It turned out to be so interesting, that me and 
my team decided to continue it!

# Goals
Goal is to provide best that stealth games can offer - responsive AI and interactive environment, that provides not solutions, but rather tools to solve problems.

But before that:

* Create documentation
* Clear existing code
*...?
